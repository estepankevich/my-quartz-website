Before translating your data into a chart or graph, you should be clear on what you want to show your audience

- Scatter plots show the relationship between data sets
- Tracking trends can help us understand shifts or changes in our data. **Line graphs** are a great tool for visually showing change over time

### **Line graph best practices:**

- To avoid clutter, don't show more than four categories.
- Organize highly variable data at the top of the chart to make it easy to read
