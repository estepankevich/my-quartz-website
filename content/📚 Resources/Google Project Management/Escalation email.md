Hi Karen and Gabriel,
[Keep it friendly and state your connection to the project]
Ihope you are doing well.As you may know,lhave been managing our Holiday
Scents product line, which is scheduled to launch in October.
[Explain the problem]
Iwould like to bring an issue to your attention. The baskets in this product line will
include scented candles, and we placed an order with Candlemakers, Inc. for 5,000
candles to be delivered to the warehouse by Friday to prepare for our first customer
shipment. To date, we have received 3,000 ofthe 5,000 candles. Unfortunately, many
ofthe candles we have received so far fail to meet our quality standards. The
packaging is damaged, or the candles themselves are broken.
[Explain the consequences]
This puts our customer satisfaction rates at risk. Failure to meet the quality
requirements for the candles by Friday will result in postponing the product launch by
three weeks. Ifthis delay occurs, we willincur an additional cost of $20,000 because
we will need to order a new shipment of candles and review the quality standards of
each to ensure that they meet our contractual agreements.
[Propose a course of action and make a request]
Ihave sourced two backup suppliers that have five-star reviews and a track record of
on-time deliveries. propose we meet with them both right away so we can onboard
one of them quickly. That way, we can avoid major delays. Are you available for a
meeting tomorrow to discuss options and come to an agreement on next steps?
Please respond with the times that work best for you.
Thank you in advance for your consideration and insight,
CAVid
