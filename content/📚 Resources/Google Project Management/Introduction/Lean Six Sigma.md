## **Lean Six Sigma**

After both Lean and Six Sigma were put into practice, it was discovered that the two methodologies could be combined to increase benefits. The tools used in Lean, such as Kanban boards and 5S, build quality in processes from the beginning. Products developed using Lean methods are then inspected or tested using Six Sigma standards. The products that do not meet these standards are rejected.

The largest difference between these methodologies is that Lean streamlines processes while Six Sigma reduces variation in products by building in quality from the beginning and inspecting products to ensure quality standards are met. You may find that one of these two methods—or using them both together—can improve the efficiency of your projects.

There are five phases in the Lean Six Sigma approach.

They are define, measure, analyze,

improve, and control, commonly known as DMAIC.

DMAIC is a strategy for process improvement,

meaning you're trying to figure out

where the problems are in

the current process and fix them

so that everything runs more smoothly
