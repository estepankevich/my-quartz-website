## **Six Sigma**

**Six Sigma** is a methodology used to reduce variations by ensuring that quality processes are followed every time. The term “Six Sigma” originates from statistics and generally means that items or processes should have 99.9996% quality.

The seven key principles of Six Sigma are:

1.  Always focus on the customer.
    
2.  Identify and understand how the work gets done. Understand how work really happens.
    
3.  Make your processes flow smoothly.
    
4.  Reduce waste and concentrate on value.
    
5.  Stop defects by removing variation.
    
6.  Involve and collaborate with your team.
    
7.  Approach improvement activity in a systematic way.
    

Use this methodology to find aspects of the product or process that are *measurable* like time, cost, or quantity. Then inspect that measurable item and reject any products that do not meet the Six Sigma standard. Any process that created unacceptable products has to be improved upon.

Now that you understand both Lean and Six Sigma, let's see how they come together to improve the performance of your project!
