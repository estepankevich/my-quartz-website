## **Lean**

**Lean** methodology is often referred to as Lean Manufacturing because it originated in the manufacturing world. The main principle in Lean methodology is the removal of waste within an operation. By optimizing process steps and eliminating waste, only value is added at each phase of production.

Today, the Lean Manufacturing methodology recognizes eight types of waste within an operation: defects, excess processing, overproduction, waiting, inventory, transportation, motion, and non-utilized talent. In the manufacturing industry, these types of waste are often attributed to issues such as:

- Lack of proper documentation
    
- Lack of process standards
    
- Not understanding the customers’ needs
    
- Lack of effective communication
    
- Lack of process control
    
- Inefficient process design
    
- Failures of management
    

These same issues create waste in project management.

Implement Lean project management when you want to use limited resources, reduce waste, and streamline processes to gain maximum benefits.

You can achieve this by using the pillars of the Lean 5S quality tool. The term 5S refers to the five pillars that are required for good housekeeping: sort, set in order, shine, standardize, and sustain. Implementing the 5S method means cleaning up and organizing the workplace to achieve the smallest amount of wasted time and material. The 5S method includes these five steps:

1.  **Sort:** Remove all items not needed for current production operations and leave only the bare essentials.
    
2.  **Set in order:** Arrange needed items so that they are easy to use. Label items so that anyone can find them or put them away.
    
3.  **Shine:** Keep everything in the correct place. Clean your workspace every day.
    
4.  **Standardize:** Perform the process in the same way every time.
    
5.  **Sustain:** Make a habit of maintaining correct procedures and instill this discipline in your team.
    

Within the Lean methodology, 5S helps you boost performance.

The final concept of Lean uses a **Kanban** scheduling system to manage production. The Kanban scheduling system, or Kanban board, is a visualization tool that enables you to optimize the flow of your team’s work. It gives the team a visual display to identify what needs to be done and when. The Kanban board uses cards that are moved from left to right to show progress and help your team coordinate the work.
