## **OKR development best practices**

Here are some best practices to keep in mind when writing OKRs:

- Think of your objectives as being motivational and inspiring and your key results as being tactical and specific. The objective describes what you want to do and the key results describe how you’ll know you did it.
    
- As a general rule, try to develop around 2–-3 key results for each objective.
    
- Be sure to document your OKRs and link to them in your project plan.
    

## **OKRs versus SMART goals**

Earlier in this lesson, you learned how to craft SMART goals for your project. While SMART goals and OKRs have some similarities, there are key differences, as well. The following article describes how SMART goals and OKRs are similar, how they differ, and when you might want to use one or the other: [Understanding the Unique Utility of OKRs vs. SMART Goals](https://www.smartsheet.com/content/okr-vs-smart-goals)
