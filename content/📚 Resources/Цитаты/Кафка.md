I think we ought to read only the kind of books that wound and stab us.

It's only because of their stupidity that they're able to be so sure of themselves.

I am in chains. Don't touch my chains.

There is an infinite amount of hope in the universe ... but not for us.

I have spent all my life resisting the desire to end it.

I usually solve problems by letting them devour me.

I cannot make you understand. I cannot make anyone understand what is happening inside me. I cannot even explain it to myself.
