The **derivative** of a function $f(x)$ measures how the function's output changes as its input changes. It represents the rate of change or slope of the function at any given point.

### Definition

The derivative of $f(x)$ at a point $x$ is defined as the limit of the difference quotient:

$$
f'(x) = \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \frac{f(x + \Delta x) - f(x)}{\Delta x}
$$

This formula gives the instantaneous rate of change of the function at the point $x$.

### Notation

The derivative of $f(x)$ can be written in several different notations:

- $f'(x)$
- $\frac{df}{dx}$
- $\frac{d}{dx} f(x)$
- $D_x f(x)$

### Geometric Interpretation

The derivative at a point $x$ is the slope of the **tangent line** to the graph of $f(x)$ at that point. If the derivative is positive, the function is increasing at that point; if it's negative, the function is decreasing
