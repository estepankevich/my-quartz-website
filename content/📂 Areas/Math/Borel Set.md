A **Borel set** is any set that can be constructed from open sets in a topological space (typically $\mathbb{R}$ with its standard topology) through countable operations, such as unions, intersections, and complements.

### Key Properties:

1. **Closed under countable operations**:
    - If $A_1, A_2, \dots$ are Borel sets, then $\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} A_n$, $\bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty} A_n$, and the complement $A^c$ are also Borel sets.
2. **Generation from open sets**:
    - The Borel $\sigma$-algebra is generated by open sets, meaning that any Borel set can be expressed in terms of open (or equivalently, closed) sets via countable unions, intersections, and complements.
3. **Includes many common sets**:
    - All open and closed sets are Borel sets.
    - Countable unions and intersections of open (or closed) sets are Borel sets.
    - Intervals such as $[a, b]$, $(a, b]$, and $(a, b)$ are Borel sets.

### Intuition:
Borel sets form a broad class of sets that include many "well-behaved" subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ (such as intervals), but they also include much more complex sets that are still describable in terms of open sets through countable processes.

### Importance:
Borel sets are fundamental in measure theory because they are the sets for which the Lebesgue measure is defined. The Borel $\sigma$-algebra allows us to extend the notion of measure beyond simple geometric objects like intervals to more complicated sets.
