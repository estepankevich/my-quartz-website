$\mathbb{Q} = \{m/n | m,n \in \mathbb{Z} \}$  with equivalence classes for irreducible form
Sum and multiplication are well defined (may be verified that we get the same equivalency class)
Order is well defined 

Correspondance n/1 -> n is isomorphism to N

Not good enough to solve all polynomial equations.
Haps sets without LUB.

$\mathbb{Q}$ is ordered field = order is preserved by field operations

### Archimidian property
For x, y | x>0 exists n s.t xn > y. Prouved by contradiction
