The **Borel $\sigma$-algebra** on a topological space $X$ (typically $\mathbb{R}$ with its standard topology) is the smallest $\sigma$-algebra that contains all open sets in $X$. Denoted by $\mathcal{B}(X)$, it includes all sets that can be constructed from open sets using countable unions, countable intersections, and complements. Sets in this $\sigma$-algebra are called [[Borel Set|Borel Sets]]

### Properties:
1. **Contains open and closed sets**: Since the Borel $\sigma$-algebra is generated by open sets, it contains all open sets and their complements (i.e., all closed sets).
2. **Closed under countable operations**: If $A_1, A_2, \dots$ are Borel sets, then:
    - The countable union $\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} A_n$ is a Borel set.
    - The countable intersection $\bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty} A_n$ is a Borel set.
    - The complement $A^c$ of any Borel set is also a Borel set.
3. **Contains intervals**: In $\mathbb{R}$, all common intervals (open, closed, half-open) such as $(a, b)$, $[a, b]$, $(a, b]$, and $[a, b)$ are Borel sets because they can be expressed as open or closed sets.
4. **Generated by a base**: For example, in $\mathbb{R}$, the Borel $\sigma$-algebra can be generated by:
    - The collection of all open intervals $(a, b)$.
    - Equivalently, by all closed intervals $[a, b]$.
