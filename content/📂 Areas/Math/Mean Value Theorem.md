The Mean Value Theorem (MVT) states that if a function $f$ is continuous on the closed interval $[a,b]$ and differentiable on the open interval $(a, b)$, then there exists at least one point $c \in (a, b)$ such that:

$$f'(c) =\frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}$$

This means that the instantaneous rate of change (the derivative) at some point $c$ is equal to the average rate of change over the interval $[a,b]$.
