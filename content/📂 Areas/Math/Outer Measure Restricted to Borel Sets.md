**Outer Measure Restricted to Borel Sets**

If an [[Outer Measure]] $\mu^*$ is restricted to the [[Borel sigma algebra]] $\mathcal{B}$, it becomes a proper [[Measure]]. That is, the function $\mu: \mathcal{B} \to [0, \infty]$ defined by
$$ \mu(A) = \mu^*(A) \quad \text{for all} \, A \in \mathcal{B} $$
is a measure.
