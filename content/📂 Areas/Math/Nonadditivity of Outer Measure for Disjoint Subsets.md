Let $A$ and $B$ be two disjoint sets. The [[Outer Measure]] $m^*(\cdot)$ is not generally additive for disjoint sets, meaning:

$$
m^*(A \cup B) \neq m^*(A) + m^*(B)
$$

This occurs because the outer measure is based on coverings by arbitrary sets, not necessarily disjoint coverings. For two disjoint sets $A$ and $B$, the outer measure of their union may be strictly less than the sum of the outer measures of the individual sets.
