## Definition 1
Say $E \subset S$ ordered 
if $\exists \beta : \forall x \in E \implies x \leq \beta$ 
We we call $\beta$ an upper bound for $E$ 

## Defintion 2
If $\exists \alpha \in S \mid \alpha$ is upper bound and $\nexists \beta \leq \alpha \mid \beta$ is upper bound => $\alpha$  is LUB (sup)

## Definition 3
LUB property. Every nonempty subset that has upper bound has LUB
## Observation
Finite ordered sets have sup
