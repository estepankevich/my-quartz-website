$\mathbb{R}$ - set of all Dedekind cuts.
Ordered complete field with LUB property and contains $\mathbb{Q}$ as subfield. The only field with thos property. 

$x^2=2$ has no solutions in $\mathbb{Q}$. Proved by contradiction => $\mathbb{Q}$ has holes

### Dedekind cut definition :
$\alpha$ is a subset of $\mathbb{Q}$ s.t.:
- Not empty and not $\mathbb{Q}$
- Closed to the left (for every x in $\alpha$ if y<x => y in $\alpha$ )
- Does not contain the greatest element

Then we define the order and arithmetics using cuts.

### Cantor completion definition:
Completing $\mathbb{Q}$ ([[Complete metric space]])
