## Definition : convergence of the [[Sequence]]
$\{p_n\}$ converges in $X$ (metric space)  if $$\exists p \in X \mid \forall \epsilon \exists N \mid \forall n \geq N \implies dist(p, p_n) < \epsilon$$ 
$$\lim_{n\to\infty}p_n = p$$

### Properties
- Unique
- Sequence is bounded
- If $p$  is a limit point => there is a sequence 
- If countable infinite number of distinct elements => Limit point
- $\Leftrightarrow$  for every neighborhood infinitely many points inside
- lim if sum = sum of limits
- multiplying by constant is allowed 
- multiplying of sequences is allowed 
- taking the subsequence keeps the limit

## Theorems :
### 1
Bounded monotonic sequence converges
