Let $A$ and $B$ be two sets. If there exist **injective** (one-to-one) functions $f: A \to B$ and $g: B \to A$, then there exists a **bijective** function $h: A \to B$. In other words, if $A$ can be injected into $B$ and $B$ can be injected into $A$, then $A$ and $B$ have the same cardinality (i.e., there is a one-to-one correspondence between them)

**Proof Outline:**  
The proof involves constructing the bijection $h: A \to B$ from the injective functions $f$ and $g$. The construction typically involves partitioning the sets based on the images of $f$ and $g$, and then carefully defining $h$ on these partitions.
