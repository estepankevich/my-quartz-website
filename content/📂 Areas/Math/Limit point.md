## Definition
$p \in X$ is a limit point of $E$  if every neighborhood of $p$ contains a point $q \in E$ 

- **Isolated point**: if $p \in X$ is the only point in the neighborhood 
- **Inner point**: if some neighborhood is fully contained in $E$ 

## Theorem 
If $p$ is a limit point of $E$ then every neighborhood contains infinitely many points in $E$
