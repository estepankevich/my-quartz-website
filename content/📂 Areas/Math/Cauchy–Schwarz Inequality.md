Let $V$ be a **normed vector space** with an inner product $\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle$. For all vectors $u, v \in V$, the **Cauchy–Schwarz inequality** states that:

$$∣⟨u,v⟩∣≤∣∣u∣∣⋅∣∣v∣∣$$

where $||u||$ and $||v||$ are the norms of $u$ and $v$, defined by:

$$||u|| = \sqrt{\langle u, u \rangle}$$
