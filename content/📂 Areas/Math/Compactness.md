## Definitions:
### Open Cover
Collection of open sets, whose union contains the current set
### Subcover
Subcollection of the cover that is still the cover
### Compact set
A topological space X is called compact if every open cover of X has a finite subcover

### Bounded set
If there is a ball containing the set

## Motivation 
- Dealing with the infinity. Compact set is the next best thing after finite set
- Seeks to generalize the notion of a closed and bounded subset of Euclidean space
- Compactness is intrinsic property of the set

## Theorems
### 1
Finite set is compact 
### 2 
Compact set is bounded and closed
### 3
For $K \subset Y \subset X$,  $K$ is compact in $Y \Leftrightarrow K$ is compact in $X$
### 4
Closed subset of the compact set is compact
### Heine -Borel
Bounded and closed sets in $\mathbb{R}^n$ are compact
### 5
K compact $\Leftrightarrow$ every infinite subset has a limit point in K
### Cantor
For the collection K of the compact subsets of X (some metric space). If every finite sub collection has a non empty intersection then the intersection of the entire collection is not empty

Proof: By contradiction using the compliment of K - open sets. No intersection==> compliment covers the whole space 
### 6
K compact $\Leftrightarrow$  every collection of closed sets that has the [[Finite intersection property (FIP)]] has non empty intersection 
### 7
Compactness is equivalent to sequential Compactness
### 8
Compact metric space is [[Complete metric space]] 
### 9
Continuous image of the compact is compact
