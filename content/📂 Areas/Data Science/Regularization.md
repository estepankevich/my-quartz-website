**Definition**:  
Regularization is a technique used in machine learning and optimization to prevent **overfitting** by adding a penalty term to the loss function. It encourages simpler models by discouraging overly complex or high-magnitude parameters, improving the model's ability to generalize to unseen data.

**Types**: 
- L1
- L2
- Combined

**Visualization of L1 vs L2 regularizations**:
