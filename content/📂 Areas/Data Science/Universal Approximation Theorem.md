**Definition**:  
The Universal Approximation Theorem states that a feedforward neural network with a **single hidden layer** containing a **finite number of neurons** can approximate any continuous function on a [[Compactness|compact]] subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$, to any desired degree of accuracy, provided the activation function is non-linear and satisfies mild conditions (e.g., it is continuous and not a polynomial).  

**Formal Statement**:  
Let $f: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ be a continuous function defined on a compact subset $K \subset \mathbb{R}^n$. For any $\epsilon > 0$, there exists a neural network $F(x)$ with one hidden layer, using weights $\theta$, biases $b$, and a non-linear activation function $\phi$, such that:  
$$|f(x) - F(x)| < \epsilon \quad \forall x \in K.$$  

**Key Requirements**:  
1. **Compact Domain**: The theorem applies to continuous functions on compact subsets of $\mathbb{R}^n$.  
2. **Activation Function**: Common choices like the sigmoid, tanh, and ReLU satisfy the conditions for the theorem.  

**Implications**:  
- **Sufficiency, Not Efficiency**: While the theorem guarantees that a neural network can approximate a function, it does not guarantee that the network will do so efficiently. The number of neurons required may be impractically large.  
- **Architecture Generality**: Any activation function that is non-linear and continuous can serve as a universal approximator.  

**Proof Sketch**:  
The proof is based on constructing an approximation using sums of shifted and scaled versions of the activation function. One approach involves the  [[Stone-Weierstrass Theorem]], which states that certain classes of functions can uniformly approximate any continuous function.  

**Extensions**:  
1. **Multilayer Networks**: While the theorem originally applies to single-hidden-layer networks, deeper networks with multiple layers can often achieve the same approximation with fewer neurons due to their hierarchical structure.  
2. **ReLU Networks**: The theorem also holds for ReLU activation, though the constructive proofs for ReLU are more recent.  
3. **Probability Distributions**: A similar result applies to approximating probability distributions in function spaces, as seen in generative models.  

**Limitations**:  
1. **Parameter Optimization**: The theorem ensures the existence of weights and biases but does not address how to find them (i.e., training via optimization methods).  
2. **Discrete Functions**: The theorem applies to continuous functions and does not directly extend to discontinuous ones.  
3. **Practical Implementation**: The theorem does not guarantee that the network will generalize well to unseen data.  

**Applications**:  
1. **Neural Networks**: Provides a theoretical foundation for using neural networks as function approximators.  
2. **Control Systems**: Used in control theory for approximating non-linear controllers.  
3. **Scientific Computing**: Used to model complex relationships in data when the underlying function is unknown.  

**Conclusion**:  
The Universal Approximation Theorem highlights the theoretical power of neural networks, showing they can approximate any continuous function. However, practical success depends on choosing the right architecture, training methods, and regularization techniques.
