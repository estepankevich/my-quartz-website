**Definition**:  
Early stopping is a [[Regularization]] technique used in machine learning to prevent overfitting during training. It involves monitoring the model's performance on a validation set and stopping the training process when performance ceases to improve, even if the training error continues to decrease.  

---

### **How It Works**  

1. **Train the Model**:  
   - Train the model on the training dataset for multiple epochs (passes over the dataset).  

2. **Monitor Validation Performance**:  
   - After each epoch, evaluate the model on a separate validation set to compute a validation loss (or metric like accuracy).  

3. **Stop Based on Validation Loss**:  
   - If the validation loss stops decreasing (or starts increasing), it indicates that the model may be overfitting.  
   - Stop training early to preserve the model parameters corresponding to the best validation performance.  

---

### **Steps for Early Stopping**  

1. **Split the Dataset**:  
   - Use a **training set** to train the model and a **validation set** to monitor performance.  

2. **Set a Patience Parameter**:  
   - Define a patience period (number of epochs) to wait for improvement in validation performance before stopping.  

3. **Track the Best Model**:  
   - Record the model parameters whenever the validation performance improves.  

4. **Stop Training**:  
   - Halt training when no improvement occurs in the validation loss for the specified patience period.

### **Key Parameters**  

1. **Patience**:  
   - The number of epochs to wait for improvement in validation loss before stopping.  
   - A higher patience allows the model more time to converge but risks overfitting.  

2. **Delta**:  
   - The minimum change in validation loss to qualify as an improvement.  
   - Prevents stopping due to small, insignificant fluctuations.  

3. **Validation Metric**:  
   - The metric to monitor (e.g., validation loss, accuracy).  
   - Typically, validation loss is preferred because it reflects the model's generalization capability.

### **Pseudocode for Early Stopping**  

```python
best_loss = float('inf')
patience_counter = 0

for epoch in range(max_epochs):
    train_loss = train_one_epoch(model, training_data)
    val_loss = evaluate(model, validation_data)
    
    if val_loss < best_loss - delta:
        best_loss = val_loss
        best_model_weights = model.get_weights()
        patience_counter = 0
    else:
        patience_counter += 1
    
    if patience_counter > patience:
        print("Early stopping triggered!")
        model.set_weights(best_model_weights)
        break
```

### **Benefits of Early Stopping**  

1. **Prevents Overfitting**:  
   - Stops training when the model starts to overfit the training data.  

2. **Efficient Training**:  
   - Saves computational resources by halting training when further epochs are unlikely to improve generalization.  

3. **Simpler Regularization**:  
   - No additional penalty terms or hyperparameters (e.g., $\lambda$ in $L_2$ regularization).  

---

### **Drawbacks**  

1. **Dependent on Validation Set**:  
   - Performance may depend on the quality and size of the validation set.  

2. **Sensitive to Noise**:  
   - If the validation metric fluctuates due to noise, early stopping may halt training prematurely.  
   - Use the **delta** parameter to reduce sensitivity to noise.  

3. **Requires Monitoring**:  
   - Increases the complexity of the training loop compared to standard optimization.

### **Extensions and Variants**  

1. **Restore Best Model**:  
   - After stopping, reset the model parameters to the epoch with the best validation performance.  

2. **Reduce Learning Rate on Plateau**:  
   - Instead of stopping immediately, reduce the learning rate when validation performance stagnates.  

3. **Warm Restarts**:  
   - Combine early stopping with techniques like restarting training from the best model with a reduced learning rate.
