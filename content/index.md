<p>
My name is Evgeny. I'm deeply passionate about data science, mathematics, philosophy, sports, and playing the piano <br/> <br/>
Here, you'll find a collection of notes, in-depth articles, and links to various projects and reflections I've compiled over the years. I began building this digital repository some years ago, and it has since grown into a multilingual mix of English, French, and Russian content.
